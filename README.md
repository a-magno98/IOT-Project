# IOT-Project

The goal of the project is to define requirements, architecture and  prototype of an IoT system for Smart Parking to be used to monitor the different parking lots of VP-Dibris.

The monitoring systems is aimed at collecting data on empty places (how many empty places, in which parking lot, etc) and publishing these information on internal channels for staff members. 

Furthermore, the system should maintain a log with data (plate, time of arrival, etc) of every car that entered into the parking lot and provide statistics on the resulting historical information.

(1) Proposal of the architecture of the IoT system with a particular attention on the following points:

types of sensors and edge devices to be used to acquire data
communication infrastructure and middleware
software components for data acquisition, storage and processing, dashboard and visualisation and main functionalities of the different components
interaction schemes  (UML-like, state machine etc) that describe the main protocols needed in the system
2) Implement a prototype of the architecture in Node.js and/or Node-red consisting of the following components:

software components for simulating the chosen set of sensors 
middleware for data acquisition 
processing component and dashboard
You can build your prototype from scratch, as an extension of one of the projects proposed by students during 2019/20 for indoor contact tracing (see presentations on aulaweb), or adopting (service without fees of) existing IoT platform such as Azure, AWS, Ubidots, Snap4City, etc.
